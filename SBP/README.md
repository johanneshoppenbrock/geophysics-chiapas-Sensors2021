# Sub-bottom profiler (SBP) data
This subfolder contains the sub-bottom profiler data set of the lake Nah√° acquired in March 2018. 

For every line, sounding and navigation data are provided as .seg and .csv files, respectively. For some lines, we also provide the .odc files. SBP acoustic traces were visualized using the free GSEGYView (version 0.2) software provided by Bashkardin (2013). The .png output is also provided in the folder.
