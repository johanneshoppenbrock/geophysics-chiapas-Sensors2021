# Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data
This subfolder contains the Electrical resistivity tomography data set in UTM coordinates of lake Nah√° acquired in March 2018. 

# Scripts
The directory contains Matlab scripts (.m files) for the data preparation (folder 'data_sorting') for a 1D inversion with VES1Dinv (Ekinci and Demirci (2008)) and a 2D inversion with RES2DINV. 
The VES1Dinv scripts adapted for our case can be found in the folder 'Inversion'.
